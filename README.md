# Test-Plan Assets

Welcome to the Octarine Test-Plane Assets. In this repository, you will find the needed assets to help demonstrate Octarine's guardrails and runtime capabilities.
## About Octarine 
Octarine is a cloud-native network security platform for the complete lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. It helps protect your cloud-native apps from build to runtime:,

**Continuous compliance**. Meeting compliance and security obligations is not optional, but Octarine makes it easy. The platform prevents non-compliant apps from being introduced, and detects exploits and remediates in real-time for apps in production.

**Continuous hardening**. Octarine hardens Kubernetes according to security and compliance best practices, securing it with a best-in-class IDS to avoid, detect, and prevent misconfigurations.

**Automation**. Octarine automates security in fast-changing environments by detecting malicious activity and remediating automatically based on policies, meaning less burden on DevOps teams and less Kubernetes security expertise needed on staff. 


We developed the Kubernetes workloads, and runtime containers to help with Octarine POV, but can be used for any other purposes.
